# matrix-operations

Problem Statement:


 	Giver  m x n matrix inmatrix of positive integers, print integer outcum based on below logic.
 
 		1) identify all possible sets in inmatrix that contain at least four consecutive elements of the same value val ,either horizontally ,vertically, or diagonally.
 		2) if only one set of consecutive elements is identified store the value avl in outcum
 		3) if more than one set of consecutive elements is identified ,find the smallest value and store it in outcum
 		4) if no set of four cosecutive elements of the same value is identified either horizontally,vertically, or diagonally ,print -1
 
 Assumption:
 
 	m and n will be grater than 3

Input Format:

	First line wil contain number of rows m of inmatrix.
	the next m line will contain the elements of inmatrix .Each line will have n elements separated by space
	read the input from the standard input stream.

Output Format:

	Print outcum to the standard output stream.
